# Statue

Static website generator

Testing:

```vim
let test#ruby#testbench#executable = 'bin/test'
```

## TODO

 - [ ] replace all URL strings/pathnames with real URL objects
 - [ ] check that URLs are being rendered correctly into every page
 - [ ] check if canonical urls should have hostname, or just path
 - [ ] indented plain text is being highlighted in markdown, instead
   of being a quote?
