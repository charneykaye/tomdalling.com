{:title "Consistent Hammer Man"

This is a short parable I came up while discussing linters, in
response to someone asking if I think it's good to be inconsistent.

Let's imagine that Hammer Man has a hammer, and he uses it
consistently.

Need to drive in a nail? Hit it with the hammer. Need to break a rock?
Hit it with the hammer. Need to cut some wood? Smash it apart with the
hammer. Need to beat some eggs? Stir them with the hammer. Need to
turn off the TV? Throw the hammer at it.

He might look at his neighbour who uses a saw, a whisk, and a TV
remote, and think that the neighbour is inconsistent. All these
different tools take time to learn, and cost money, and take up space,
when a simple hammer could have been used instead. That's all true.

But the mistake is in assuming that consistency is always good, and
inconsistency is always bad. Hammer Man is being over-consistent,
which is bad, and the neighbour is being appropriately inconsistent,
which is good.
