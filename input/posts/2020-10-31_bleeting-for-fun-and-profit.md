Today I want to coin the term _bleet_.

<blockquote class="worddef">
  <h3 class="worddef--title">
    <span class="worddef--word">bleet</span>
    <span class="worddef--function">noun</span>
  </h3>
  <p class="worddef--ipa">bliÀêt</p>

  <ol class="worddef--definition-list">
    <li class="worddef--definition">
      <p>a short piece of writing published on a personal website,
      typically written hastily</p>
      <span class="worddef--example">I'm adding a bleet category to
      my blog</span>
    </li>
    <li class="worddef--definition">
      <p>misspelling of <em class="worddef--ref">bleat</em>: a
      feeble outcry, protest, or complaint</p>
      <span class="worddef--example">His blog is just a bunch of
      bleats about the lack of discipline in software
      developers</span>
    </li>
  </ol>

One of the reasons why I haven't been writing much in recent years is that each article takes a long time to produce.
It's more than just typing sentences until the document is full.

- ideation
- research
- outlining/structuring/sequencing
- simplifying sentences for non-native English speakers
- referencing a dictionary and thesaurus to try and ensure I'm conveying my intended meaning clearly
- investigating the origin of memes I want to use, so that I don't get myself cancelled for inadvertently using something that originated from a degenerate 4chan post
- inserting bits of sardonic humour to avoid falling asleep while writing,
  such as suggesting I might get cancelled for inadvertently using a 4chan meme
- couching charged words like "4chan" with defensive writing like "inadvertently"
  to pre-empt negligent, drive-by assumptions about my character
- general editing
- proofing
- promoting

These all take time.
Producing a finished article can take anywhere from 3 to 20 hours --- sometimes longer.

When writing inspiration finds me, my immediate thought is _can I be bothered?_
And, for a while now, the answer has been _no_.
Knowing that it will take multiple workdays of effort is enough to dissuade me from starting.

This is not a state of affairs that I'm happy about.
I would like to produce more words per month,
since [quantity begets quality][pots].

Bleets are an attempt to remedy this problem.
I intend to write bleets that are:

- shorter and more narrow in topic
- less researched and more opinionated
- unstructured
- flowery
- minimally-promoted, if at all
- sufficiently filled with enough tpyos and grammatical eras to make
  prescriptivists tantrum like a toddler

I believe that there is still value in hastily written content,
for both the reader [and the author][writing_is_thinking].
Time spent writing is more fruitful than, for example, watching Netflix.

Bleets are a personal experiment in removing friction from desired behaviours.
My hope is that by reducing the costs of writing ---
whether real or just perceived ---
I will be motivated to produce more writing.

Let's see how it goes.
